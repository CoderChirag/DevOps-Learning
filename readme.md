# Learning DevOps

This is going to be my journey to learn Devops from very basics to advanced level. I will try to share each and every step of it so it can also benefit others.

I am making this repo so that you don't have to go and search at different different places and you can find every topic here only.

I will try to provide complete notes and practical projects in complete detailed and in an easy to understand manner.

# 1. Basics of Linux

## Open Source

Open source software is a software which have its entire source code open, and anybody can inspect, modify, and enhance the software.

## Linux History

-   **1984**: The GNU Project and the Free Software Foundation
    -   Creates open source version of UNIX utilities
    -   Creates the General Public License (GPL)
        -   Software license enforcing open source principles
-   **1991**: Linus Torvalds
    -   Creates open source, UNIX-like kernel, release under the GPL
    -   Ports some GNU utilities, solicits assistance online
-   **Today**:
    -   Linux kernel + GNU utilities = complete, open source, UNIX-like operating system
        -   Packaged for targeted audiences and distributions

## Linux principles

-   Everything is a file (including hardware)
-   Small Single purpose Programs
-   Ability to chain programs together for complex operations
-   Avoid Captive User Interfaces (GUI which waits for user interaction)
-   Configuration data stored in files

## Why Linux?

-   Opensource
-   Community Support
-   Support Wide Variety of hardware
-   Customization
-   Most Servers run on Linux
-   Automation
-   Security
