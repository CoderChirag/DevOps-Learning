# Basics of Linux

## Introduction

### Open Source

Open source software is a software which have its entire source code open, and anybody can inspect, modify, and enhance the software.

### Linux History

-   **1984**: The GNU Project and the Free Software Foundation
    -   Creates open source version of UNIX utilities
    -   Creates the General Public License (GPL)
        -   Software license enforcing open source principles
-   **1991**: Linus Torvalds
    -   Creates open source, UNIX-like kernel, release under the GPL
    -   Ports some GNU utilities, solicits assistance online
-   **Today**:
    -   Linux kernel + GNU utilities = complete, open source, UNIX-like operating system
        -   Packaged for targeted audiences and distributions

### Linux principles

-   Everything is a file (including hardware)
-   Small Single purpose Programs
-   Ability to chain programs together for complex operations
-   Avoid Captive User Interfaces (GUI which waits for user interaction)
-   Configuration data stored in files

### Why Linux?

-   Opensource
-   Community Support
-   Support Wide Variety of hardware
-   Customization
-   Most Servers run on Linux
-   Automation
-   Security

### Linux Architecture

-   **Desktop based**
    -   Ubuntu Linux

### Some Important Directories

-   **Home Directories**: /root, /home/username

## Basic File Directory and Related Commands

-   `$ whoami` - shows the current user
-   `$ pwd` - present working directory
-   `$ ls [-l: long list] [-t: sort based on last updated] [-r|--reverse: reverse sort]` - list files from current directory
-   `$ cat <filename>` - view the contents of a file
-   `$ sudo -i` - switch to root user
-   `$ cd <path>` - change directory
-   `$ mkdir [-p|--parents: no error if existing] <dirname>` - makes new directory
-   `$ touch <filename>` - makes new file
-   `$ touch file1{1..10}.txt` - makes 10 new files
-   `$ cp [-r|-R|--recursive: copy recursively] <src> <dest>` - copying files
-   `mv <src> <dest>` - move or rename files
-   `rm [-r|-R|--recursive: recursive] [-f|--force: force] <filename>` - remove file

## Vim Editor

-   To install in centos: `sudo yum install vim -y`
-   To start the editor: `vim <filename>`
-   Thera are 3 modes in vim editor
    1. Command Mode
    2. Insert Mode (edit mode)
    3. Extended command mode (using `:`)
-   To set line numbers in vim: `:se nu #set numbers`

### Command Mode

|          |                                                      |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| gg       | To go to the beginning of the page                   |
| G        | To go to the end of the page                         |
| w        | To move the cursor forward, word by word             |
| b        | to move the cusor backward, word by word             |
| nw       | to move the cursor forward to n words (5w)           |
| nb       | To move the cursor backward to n words (5b)          |
| u        | To undo last change (word)                           |
| U        | To undo the previous changes (entire line)           |
| Ctrl + R | To redo the changes                                  |
| yy       | To copy a line                                       |
| nyy      | To copy n lines (5yy or 4yy)                         |
| p        | To paste line below the cursor position              |
| P        | To paste line above the cursor position              |

## File Types

-   `file <filename>`: command for checking the **file type**.

|              |     |                                                                                                            |
| ------------ | --- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Regular File | -   | Normal files such as text, data, or executable files                                                       |
| Directory    | d   | Files that are lists of other files                                                                        |
| Link         | l   | A shortcut that points to the location of the actual file                                                  |
| Special File | c   | Mechanism used for input and output, such as files in /dev                                                 |
| Socket       | s   | A special file that provides inter-process networking protected by the file system's access control        |
| Pipe         | p   | A special file that allows processes to communicate with each other without using network socket semantics |

### Symbolic links

-   With symbolic links an administrator can assign a file or directory multiple identities.
-   Can be thought of as a pointer to original file. There are 2 types of symbolic links:
    1. hard links
    2. soft links

#### Soft link

-   Can cross the file system
-   Allows to link b/w directories
-   Has different inodes number and file permissions than original file
-   permissions will not be updated
-   has only the path of the original file, not the contents

#### Hard link

-   can't cross the filesystem boundaries
-   can't link directories
-   has the same inodes number and permissions of original file
-   permissions will be updated if we change the permissions of source file
-   has actual contents of original file, so that you can still view the contents, even if the original file moved or removed

#### Creating symbolic links

-   `ln -s <sourcefile> <soflink file>`: creates a softlink
-   `ln <sourcefile> <hardlink-file>`: creates a hardlink
