# Learning DevOps

This is going to be my journey to learn Devops from very basics to advanced level. I will try to share each and every step of it so it can also benefit others.

I am making this repo so that you don't have to go and search at different different places and you can find every topic here only.

I will try to provide complete notes and practical projects in complete detailed and in an easy to understand manner.

**NOTE**
The content I am providing here in not completely mine. I am just integrating everything from different different places and serving it on one place so that you don't have to search for anything.

# Get Started

-   To get started, go to the main folder of the main branch, and check the readme file.
-   The readme file of the main branch is the main file you have to follow along in the journey.
-   As the journey proceeds, you have to visit different different branches to study the topics in detail, but the base is the main readme file which will guide you which branch to follow next and so on.

**Note**

-   I have shifted all the content of the main branch inside the main folder temporarily till this repo is completed.
-   After the completion of the repo, that content would again be moved outside of the main folder.

And please don't forget to star the repo :star:. Happy Learning :sunglasses:
