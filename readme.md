# Basics of Linux

## Introduction

### Open Source

Open source software is a software which have its entire source code open, and anybody can inspect, modify, and enhance the software.

<div align="center">

</div>

### Linux History

-   **1984**: The GNU Project and the Free Software Foundation
    -   Creates open source version of UNIX utilities
    -   Creates the General Public License (GPL)
        -   Software license enforcing open source principles
-   **1991**: Linus Torvalds
    -   Creates open source, UNIX-like kernel, release under the GPL
    -   Ports some GNU utilities, solicits assistance online
-   **Today**:
    -   Linux kernel + GNU utilities = complete, open source, UNIX-like operating system
        -   Packaged for targeted audiences and distributions

### Linux principles

-   Everything is a file (including hardware)
-   Small Single purpose Programs
-   Ability to chain programs together for complex operations
-   Avoid Captive User Interfaces (GUI which waits for user interaction)
-   Configuration data stored in files

### Why Linux?

-   Opensource
-   Community Support
-   Support Wide Variety of hardware
-   Customization
-   Most Servers run on Linux
-   Automation
-   Security

### Linux Architecture

<div align="center">

-   `$ pwd` - present working directory
-   `$ ls [-l: long list] [-t: sort based on last updated] [-r|--reverse: reverse sort]` - list files from current directory
-   `$ cat <filename>` - view the contents of a file
-   `$ sudo -i` - switch to root user
-   `$ cd <path>` - change directory
-   `$ mkdir [-p|--parents: no error if existing] <dirname>` - makes new directory
-   `$ touch <filename>` - makes new file
-   `$ touch file1{1..10}.txt` - makes 10 new files
-   `$ cp [-r|-R|--recursive: copy recursively] <src> <dest>` - copying files
-   `mv <src> <dest>` - move or rename files
-   `rm [-r|-R|--recursive: recursive] [-f|--force: force] <filename>` - remove file
-   `wc [-c: byte counts] [-m: char counts] [-l: lines count] [-L: max line length] [-w: words counts]` - print newline, word, and bytte counts for each file

## Vim Editor

-   To install in centos: `sudo yum install vim -y`
-   To start the editor: `vim <filename>`
-   Thera are 3 modes in vim editor
    1. Command Mode
    2. Insert Mode (edit mode)
    3. Extended command mode (using `:`)
-   To set line numbers in vim: `:se nu #set numbers`

### Command Mode

|          |                                                      |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| gg       | To go to the beginning of the page                   |
| G        | To go to the end of the page                         |
| w        | To move the cursor forward, word by word             |
| b        | to move the cusor backward, word by word             |
| nw       | to move the cursor forward to n words (5w)           |
| nb       | To move the cursor backward to n words (5b)          |
| u        | To undo last change (word)                           |
| U        | To undo the previous changes (entire line)           |
| Ctrl + R | To redo the changes                                  |
| yy       | To copy a line                                       |
| nyy      | To copy n lines (5yy or 4yy)                         |
| p        | To paste line below the cursor position              |
| P        | To paste line above the cursor position              |
| dw       | To delete the word letter by letter (like Backspace) |
| x        | To delete the word letter by letter (like DEL key)   |
| dd       | To delete entire line                                |
| ndd      | To delete n no. of lines from cursor pointer (5dd)   |
| /        | To search a word in the file                         |

-   We can directly search in vim editor by writing forward slash(/) in **command mode**, eg: `/abcd`.
-   We can directly search and replace in vim editor in command mode by writing like this, `%s/coronavirus/covid19` (all coronavirus would be replaced by covid19).
-   It will be replaced once in every line, if you want to replace globally: `%s/coronavirus/covid19/g`

## File Types

-   `file <filename>`: command for checking the **file type**.

|              |     |                                                                                                            |
| ------------ | --- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Regular File | -   | Normal files such as text, data, or executable files                                                       |
| Directory    | d   | Files that are lists of other files                                                                        |
| Link         | l   | A shortcut that points to the location of the actual file                                                  |
| Special File | c   | Mechanism used for input and output, such as files in /dev                                                 |
| Socket       | s   | A special file that provides inter-process networking protected by the file system's access control        |
| Pipe         | p   | A special file that allows processes to communicate with each other without using network socket semantics |

### Symbolic links

-   With symbolic links an administrator can assign a file or directory multiple identities.
-   Can be thought of as a pointer to original file. There are 2 types of symbolic links:
    1. hard links
    2. soft links

#### Soft link

-   Can cross the file system
-   Allows to link b/w directories
-   Has different inodes number and file permissions than original file
-   permissions will not be updated
-   has only the path of the original file, not the contents

#### Hard link

-   can't cross the filesystem boundaries
-   can't link directories
-   has the same inodes number and permissions of original file
-   permissions will be updated if we change the permissions of source file
-   has actual contents of original file, so that you can still view the contents, even if the original file moved or removed

#### Creating symbolic links

-   `ln -s <sourcefile> <soflink file>`: creates a **softlink**
-   `ln <sourcefile> <hardlink-file>`: creates a **hardlink**

## Filters

### grep

-   Used for searching the keywords of regexp in a file
-   > grep [-i : case insensitive] [-r|-R : recursive] [-v: don't show the given keyword] \<keyword | regexp> \<input>
-   Example
    -   Searching for a config in all files in afolder and its subfolders
    -   > grep -R SELINUX /etc/\*

### less

-   A reader to read the contents of 1 or more file and looks just like vim.
-   You can use up/down arrow to move, forward slash(/) to search, and q to quit.
-   > less \<filename>

### more

-   Just like less but have to press enter to move down.
-   Difference is that `more` allows us to view one or more files as a single file spearated by lines, whereas `less` allows us to switch between them.
-   > more \<filename>

### head

-   Shows the specified no. of lines from the beginning of a file
-   > head [-\<n>: no of lines to show, by default 10] \<filename>
-   For eg `$ head -20 anaconda-ks.cfg`

### tail

-   Shows the specified no. of lines from the bottom of a file
-   have very useful functionality of displaying the content in raltime by using `-f` option.
-   > tail [-\<n>: no o lines to show, by default 10] [-f : realtime changes to file] \<filename>

### cut

-   Used to separate the required content from a file in which content is separated by a fixed delimiter
-   > cut [-d\<d>: delimiter `d`] [-f\<n>: column `n`] \<file>
-   Example
    -   Getting all the usernames from /etc/passwd file
    -   `$ cut -d: f1 /etc/passwd`

### awk

-   Advanced pattern scanning and processing language
-   Operations:
    1. Scans a file line by line
    2. Splits each input line into fields
    3. Compares input line/fields to pattern
    4. Performs action(s) on matched lines
-   Useful for:
    1. Transform data files
    2. Produce formatted reports
-   Programming Constructs:
    1. Formal output lines
    2. Arithmetic and string operations
    3. Conditionals and loops
-   Syntax: `awk options 'selection_criteria {action}' input-file > output-file`
-   Options:
    ```
    -f program-file : Reads the AWK program source from the file program-file, instead of from the first command line argument.
    -F fs           : Use fs for the input field separator
    ```
-   Sample Commands
    -   **Example:** Consider the following text file as the input file for all cases below:
        `$ cat > employee.txt`
        <br>
        ```
        ajay manager account 45000
        sunil clerk account 25000
        varun manager sales 50000
        amit manager account 47000
        tarun peon sales 15000
        deepak clerk sales 23000
        sunil peon sales 13000
        satvik director purchase 80000
        ```
    1.  **Default behaviour of Awk:** By default Awk prints every line of data from the specified file.<br>`$ awk {print} employee.txt`<br>**Output:**
        ```
        ajay manager account 45000
        sunil clerk account 25000
        varun manager sales 50000
        amit manager account 47000
        tarun peon sales 15000
        deepak clerk sales 23000
        sunil peon sales 13000
        satvik director purchase 80000
        ```
    2.  Print the lines which match the given pattern<br>`$ awk '/manager/ {print}' employee.txt`<br>**Output:**
        ```
        ajay manager account 45000
        varun manager sales 50000
        amit manager account 47000
        ```
    3.  **Splitting a line into fields:** For each record, i.e, line, the awk command splits the record delimited by whitespace character by default and stores it in the `$n` variables.<br>Also, `$0` represents the whole line.<br>`$ awk '{print $1,$4}' employee.txt`<br>**Output:**
        ```
        ajay 45000
        sunil 25000
        varun 50000
        amit 47000
        tarun 15000
        deepak 23000
        sunil 13000
        satvik 80000
        ```

#### Built-In Variables in Awk

Awk's built-in variables include the field variables - `$1`, `$2`, `$3`, and so on (`$0` is the entire line) - that break a line of text into individual words or pieces called **fieds**.

-   **NR:** NR command keeps a current count of the number of input records (lines).
-   **NF:** NF command keeps a count of the number of fields within the current input record.
-   **FS:** FS command contains the field separator character which is used to divide fields on the input line. The default is “white space”, meaning space and tab characters. FS can be reassigned to another character (typically in BEGIN) to change the field separator.
-   **RS:** RS command stores the current record separator character. Since, by default, an input line is the input record, the default record separator character is a newline.
-   **OFS:** OFS command stores the output field separator, which separates the fields when Awk prints them. The default is a blank space. Whenever print has several parameters separated with commas, it will print the value of OFS in between each parameter.
-   **ORS:** ORS command stores the output record separator, which separates the output lines when Awk prints them. The default is a newline character. print automatically outputs the contents of ORS at the end of whatever it is given to print.
-   **Examples:**

    -   **Use of NR built-in variables (Display Line Number)**<br> `$ awk '{print NR,$0}' employee.txt`<br>**Output:**

        ```
            1 ajay manager account 45000
            2 sunil clerk account 25000
            3 varun manager sales 50000
            4 amit manager account 47000
            5 tarun peon sales 15000
            6 deepak clerk sales 23000
            7 sunil peon sales 13000
            8 satvik director purchase 80000
        ```

    -   **Use of NF built-in variables (Display Last Field)**<br>`$ awk '{print $1,$NF}' employee.txt`<br>**Output:**
        ```
        ajay 45000
        sunil 25000
        varun 50000
        amit 47000
        tarun 15000
        deepak 23000
        sunil 13000
        satvik 80000
        ```
    -   **Another use of NR built-in variables (Display Line From 3 to 6)**<br>`$ awk 'NR==3, NR==6 {print NR,$0}' employee.txt`<br>**Output:**
        ```
        3 varun manager sales 50000
        4 amit manager account 47000
        5 tarun peon sales 15000
        6 deepak clerk sales 23000
        ```
    -   **Practical Example:** Finding all the usernames from `/etc/passwd` file<br> `$ awk -F':' '{print $1}' /etc/passwd`

### sed

-   SED command in UNIX stands for stream editor and it can perform lots of functions on file like searching, find and replace, insertion or deletion.
-   Most common use of SED command is for find and replace.
-   By using SED we can edit files even without opening them.
-   **Syntax:**
    `$ sed OPTIONS... [SCRIPT] [INPUTFILE...]`
-   **Example:**<br>Consider the below text file as an input.<br>`$ cat > inputfile.txt`<br><br>

    ```
    unix is great os. unix is opensource. unix is free os.
    learn operating system.
    unix linux which one you choose.
    unix is easy to learn.unix is a multiuser os.Learn unix .unix is a powerful.
    ```

    1.  **Replacing or substituting string :** Sed command is mostly used to replace the text in a file. The below simple sed command replaces the word “unix” with “linux” in the file.<br>`$ sed 's/unix/linux' inputfile.txt #Changes the 1st occurence of 'unix' in every line `<br>**Output:**
        ```
        linux is great os. unix is opensource. unix is free os.
        learn operating system.
        linux linux which one you choose.
        linux is easy to learn.unix is a multiuser os.Learn unix .unix is a powerful
        ```
        Here the`s` specifies the substitution operation. The `/` are delimiters. The `unix` is the search pattern and the `linux` is the replacement string.
    2.  **Replacing the nth occurrence of a pattern in a line :** Use the /1, /2 etc flags to replace the first, second occurrence of a pattern in a line.<br>`$ sed 's/unix/linux/2' inputfile.txt`<br>**Output:**
        ```
        unix is great os. linux is opensource. unix is free os.
        learn operating system.
        unix linux which one you choose.
        unix is easy to learn.linux is a multiuser os.Learn unix .unix is a powerful.
        ```
    3.  **Replacing all the occurrence of the pattern in a line :** The substitute flag /g (global replacement) specifies the sed command to replace all the occurrences of the string in the line.<br>`$ sed 's/unix/linux/g' inputfile.txt`<br>**Output:**
        ```
        linux is great os. linux is opensource. linux is free os.
        learn operating system.
        linux linux which one you choose.
        linux is easy to learn.linux is a multiuser os.Learn linux .linux is a powerful.
        ```
    4.  **Replacing from nth occurrence to all occurrences in a line :** Use the combination of /1, /2 etc and /g to replace all the patterns from the nth occurrence of a pattern in a line. The following sed command replaces the third, fourth, fifth… “unix” word with “linux” word in a line.<br>`$ sed 's/unix/linux/3g' inputfile.txt`<br>**Output:**
        ```
        unix is great os. unix is opensource. linux is free os.
        learn operating system.
        unix linux which one you choose.
        unix is easy to learn.unix is a multiuser os.Learn linux .linux is a powerful.
        ```
    5.  **Parenthesize first character of each word**<br>`$ echo "Welocme To The Family" | sed 's/\(\b[A-Z]\)/\(\1\)/g'`<br>**Explaination:**

        ```
        sed 's/\b(pattern1)/pattern2/g' --- Does " A word by word search"

            sed 's/\(\b[A-Z]\)/pattern2/g'  --- Does " Matches a single uppercase letter"
            sed 's/\(\b[A-Z]\)/\(\1\)/g'     --- Does " sed 's/\(\b[A-Z]\)/\([A-Z]\)/g' "
                                            \1 is a back reference.
        ```

        **Output:**<br>`(W)elcome (T)o (T)he (G)eek (S)tuff`

    6.  **Replacing string on a specific line number :**<br>`$ sed '3 s/unix/linux' inputfile.txt`<br>**Output:**

        ```

    10. **Deleting lines from a particular file :** SED command can also be used for deleting lines from a particular file. SED command is used for performing deletion operation without even opening the file<br>**Examples:**<br>1. **To Delete a particular line say n in this example**<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Syntax:** `$ sed 'nd' filename.txt`<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Example:** `$ sed '5d' filename.txt`<br>2. **To Delete a last line**<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Syntax:** `$ sed '$d' filename.txt`<br>3. **To Delete line from range x to y**<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Syntax:** `$ sed 'x,yd' filename.txt`<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Example:** `$ sed '3,6d' filename.txt`<br>4. **To Delete from nth to last line**<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Syntax:** `$ sed 'nth,$d' filename.txt`<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Example:** `$ sed '12,$d' filename.txt`<br>5. **To Delete pattern matching line**<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Syntax:** `$ sed '/pattern/d' filename.txt`<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Example:** `$ sed '/abc/d' filename.txt`

## Redirections

|                           |                                                                 |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `$ command > file`        | redirect **stdout** to **overwrite** a file                     |
| `$ command >> file`       | redirect **stdout** to **append** a file                        |
| `$ command 2> file`       | redirect **stderr** to **overwrite** a file                     |
| `$ command 2>> file`      | redirect **stderr** to **append** a file                        |
| `$ command > /dev/null`   | discard / dump **stdout** messages                              |
| `$ command 2> /dev/null`  | discard / dump **stderr** messages                              |
| `$ command &> file`       | redirect both **stdout** and **stderr** to **overwrite** a file |
| `$ command &>> file`      | redirect both **stdout** and **stderr** to **append** a file    |
| `$ command &>> /dev/null` | dump / discard all the output                                   |

-   `/dev/null` is a dump file. We can dump any content in it and it would always be empty.
-   `>file` is equivalent to `1>file` and `>>file` is equivalent to `1>>file`

## Pipelines

-   A **pipeline** is a sequence of one or more commands seperated by the pipe character `|`.
-   A pipe connects the standard output of the 1st command to the standard input of the next command.

<div align='center'>

![pipelines](./images/pipe-redirection-1.png)

</div>

-   **Examples:**
    -   `$ ls -l /usr/bin | less`
    -   `$ ls | wc -l`

### tee

-   **Limitation of pipelining:** When redirection is combined with a pipeline, the shell sets up the entire pipeline first, then it redirects input / output.
    If output redirection is used in the middle of a pipeline, the output will go to the file and **not** to the next command in the pipeline.

-   **Example:** `$ ls > /tmp/saved-output | less #output goes to the file and less displays nothing on the screen`
-   The **_tee_** command overcomes this limitation.
<div align='center'>

![tee](./images/tee.png)

</div>

-   **Example:** `$ ls -l | tee /tmp/seved-output | less`

## Users and Groups

### Users

#### Some Important Points

-   Users and groups are used to control access to files and resources
-   Users login to the system by supplying their username and password
-   Every file on the system is owned by a user and associated with a group
-   Every process has an owner and group affiliation, and can only access the resources its owner or group can access
    <br>

-   Every user of the system is assigned a **unique user ID number (the UID)**
-   Users name and UID are stored in `/etc/passwd`
-   User's password is stored in `/etc/shadow` in encrypted form
-   Users are assigned a **home directory** and a program that is run when they login (Usually a shell)
-   Users cannot read, write or execute each other's files without permission

#### Types of User

| Type        | Example              | User ID (ID)  | Group ID (GID) | Home Dir         | Shell           |
| ----------- | -------------------- | ------------- | -------------- | ---------------- | --------------- |
| **Root**    | root                 | 0             | 0              | `/root`          | `/bin/bash`     |
| **Regular** | coderchirag, vagrant | 1000 to 60000 | 1000 to 60000  | `/home/username` | `/bin/bash`     |
| **Service** | ftp, ssh, apache     | 1 to 999      | 1 to 999       | `/var/ftp etc`   | `/sbin/nologin` |

#### `/etc/passwd` file

-   Total 7 columns seperated by colon (`:`)
-   user_name:pwd(link to shadow file):uid:gid:comment:home_dir:login_shell

#### `/etc/group` file

-   Total 4 columns seperated by colon (`:`)
-   group_name:pwd(link to shadow file):gid:users_list(separated by commas (`,`)

### Groups

-   A **group** is a collection of users that need to share acess to fiiles and other system resources.
-   Every user has exactly one **primary group** and zero or more **supplementary groups**.

#### Basic commands

-   `$ id <username>` - outputs uid, gid, and groups
-   `$ useradd <username>` - creates new user
-   `$ groupadd <groupname>` - create new group
-   `$ usermod [-g group: primary group] [-G groups: supplementary groups] [-c comment] <username>` - modify the user config
-   `$ userdel [-r: delete the home directory also] <username>` - delete a user
-   `passwd <username>` - set the password of user
-   `$ groupmod [-n name: new name] [-g gid: new gid] <groupname>` - modify the group
-   `$ groupdel <groupname>` - delete the group (cannot delete a group if it is a primary group for any existing user).
-   `$ last` - give the details of which user logged in at what time
-   `$ who` - which user is currently logged in
-   `$ lsof -u <user>` - list files opened by the user (to install `$ yum install lsof -y`).

#### Switching users

-   Firstly create a password for **root** user - `$ sudo passwd`.
-   The `su` command allows you to switch users
    -   switching as root user - `$ sudo su -` or `$ sudo -i #Switch to root acount properly` or `$ sudo -s #Just run the root shell only`.
    -   switching to other users - `$ sudo su - user01`.

## File Permissions

-   Four symbols are used when displaying permissions:
    -   **r :** permission to read a file or list a directory's contents
    -   **w :** permission to write to a file or create and remove files from a directory
    -   **x :** permission to execute a program or change into a directory and do a long listing of the directory
    -   **- :** no permission (in place of the r, w or x)
-   File permissions may be viewed using `ls -l`<br>`$ ls -l /bin/login`

    ```
    -rwxr-xr-x. 1 root root 19080 Apr 1 18:26 /bin/login

    - => filetype
    rw- => user
    r-x => group
    r-x => others
    1 => link count
    root => owner user
    root => owner group
    19080 => filesize
    Apr 1 18:26 => Last modification date & time
    /bin/login => filename
    ```

### Changing Permissions

#### Symbolic Method

-   To change access modes :
    -   `$ chmod [-option]... mode[,mode] file|directory...`
-   **mode** includes :
    -   **u**, **g** or **o** for user, group and other
    -   **+**, **-** or **=** for grant, deny or set
    -   **r**, **w**, or **x** for read, write and execute
-   Options include :
    -   **-R** Recursive
    -   **-v** Verbose
    -   **--reference** Reference another file for its mode
-   Examples :
    -   `$ chmod ugo+r file` - Grant read access to all for file
    -   `$ chmod o-wx dir` - Deny write and execute to others for dir

#### Numeric Method

-   Uses a three-digit mode nummber
    -   first digit specifies **owner's** permissions
    -   second digit specifies **group** permissions
    -   third digit represents **others'** permissions
-   Permissions are calculated by adding :
    -   4 (for read)
    -   2 (for write)
    -   1 (for execute)
-   Example :
    -   `$ chmod 640 myfile`

### Changing ownership

-   To change ownership :
    -   `$ chown [-option]... user:group file|directory`
-   Options include :
    -   **-R** Recursive
    -   **-v** Verbose
-   Examples :
    -   `$ chown -R student dir` - Changes the user ownership to _student_ recursively
    -   `$ chown :admins file` - Changesthe group ownership to _admins_
    -   `$ chown aws:devops file` - Changes the user ownership to _aws_ and group ownership to _devops_

### Special Permissions

| Special Permission | Effect on files                                                              | Effect on directories                                                                               |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **u+s** (suid)     | File executes as the user that owns the file, not the user that ran the file | No effect                                                                                           |
| **g+s** (guid)     | Files executes as the group that owns the file                               | Files newly created in the directory have their owner set to match the group owner of the directory |
| **o+t** (sticky)   | No effect                                                                    | Users with write access to directory can only remove files they own                                 |

-   Can be set as follows :
    -   **Symbolically** : **setuid** = `u+s`; **setgid** = `g+s`; **sticky** = `o+t`
    -   **Numerically** (4th preceding digit) : **setuid** = 4; **setgid** = 2; **sticky** = 1
    -   Examples :
        -   `$ chmod g+s directory`
        -   `$ chmod 2770 directory #equivalent to g+s as 2 is written`

#### setuid permission

-   The **setuid** (suid) permission on an executable means that commands run as the user owning the file, not as the user that ran the command.
-   Example :
    -   `$ ls -l /usr/bin/passwd`
        ```
        -rwsr-xr-x. 1 root root 35504 Jul 16 2010 /usr/bin/passwd
        ```
    -   Here **s** is the **setuid** permission, written where normally execute (x) permission is written.
-   If the owner does not have execute permission, it will be replaced by an uppercase **S**.

#### setgid permission

-   The **setgid** (sgid) permission on a directory means that files created in the directory inherit their group ownership from the directory, rather than inheriting it from the creating user.
-   Example :
    -   `$ ls -ld /run/log/journal`
        ```
        drwxr-sr-x 3 root systemd-journal 60 May 18 09:15 /run/log/journal
        ```
    -   Here **s** is the **setgid** permission, written where normally execute (x) permission is written.
-   If the group does not have execute permission, it will be replaced by an uppercase **S**.

#### sticky permission

-   The **sticky bit** for a directory sets a special restriction on deletion of files.
-   Only the owner of the file (and root) can delete files within the directory.
-   Example :
    -   `$ ls -ld /tmp`
        ```
        drwxrwxrwt 39 root 4096 Feb 8 20:52 /tmp
        ```
    -   Here **t** is the **sticky** permission, written where normally execute (x) permission is written.
-   If others do not have execute permission, it will be replaced by an uppercase **T**.

### Default File Permissions - umask

-   If we create a new directory, default permissions are : 0777 (drwxrwxrwx)
-   If we create a new regular file, default permissions are : 0666 (-rw-rw-rw-)
    <br>
-   However, we can change it using **umask**
-   If a bit is set in **umask**, then corresponding permission will be cleared on new file.
-   For eg, the `$ umask 0002` clears the wirte bit for other users.
-   The `umask ` command without arguments will display the current value of the shell's umask. `$ umask` - `002`

## Sudo

-   sudo gives power to a normal user to execue commands which is owned by root user.
-   Not every user have the privilige to do sudo.
-   For giving any user or group acces to sudo we have to add them in `/etc/sudoers` file.
    -   `$ ls -l /etc/sudoers` - `-r--r-----. 1 root root 4328 Feb 12 17:54 /etc/sudoers`
    -   So event root user don't have write access to this file
    -   We **should not** change this file's permissions, instead we should write command `$ visudo` which will open this file in write mode.
    -   Search for the line `root ALL=(ALL) ALL` and insert new line below it to give any other user or group sudo privilige.
    -   For giving privilige to group, add a percentage sign (%) before the name.
    -   For giving privilige to a user or group so that password is not required for doing sudo, write `NOPASSWD:`
    -   Example :
        ```
        ....
        root        ALL=(ALL)       ALL
        ansible     ALL=(ALL)       NOPASSWD:       ALL
        %aws        ALL=(ALL)       ALL
        ...
        ```
-   For preventing any human error in `/etc/sudoers` file, we make a new file for the user or group we want to give sudo privilige in the `/etc/sudoers.d` directory.

## Package Management

### Basic way of installing any package in CentOS

-   Go to browser, search for package and copy the link
-   `$ curl <package_link> -o <package_name>.rpm`
-   `rpm [-i: interactive] [-v: verbose] [-h: human readable] <package_name>.rpm`

|                                                   |                                                                                |                                                              |

## Services

-   A service is a program that runs in the background otuside the interactive control of system users as they lack an interface.
-   `systemctl` command is used for managing services in linux

### Basic commands

-   `$ systemctl status httpd`
-   `$ systemctl start httpd`
-   `$ systemctl restart httpd`
-   `$ systemctl reload httpd` - reloads the config without restarting it
-   `$ systemctl stop httpd`
-   `$ systemctl enable httpd` - enables the service to start at boot time.
-   `$ systemctl is-active httpd`
-   `$ systemctl is-enabled httpd`

## Processes

-   `$ top` - show all the process running on realtime basis
-   `$ ps aux` - similar to top but displays info and quits
-   `$ps -ef` - shows Parent Process ID (PPID) but don't show the CPU and MEM Utilization

### Killing Processes

-   `kill` command is used to kill the processes.

| Signal Number | Short Name | Definition         | Purpose                                                                                                                                                  |

-   Signals can be specified to `kill` command as options either by name (eg -HUP or -SIGHUP) or by number (the related -1).
-   Users can kill their own processes, but root privilige is required to kill processes owned by others.

## Archiving Data

-   `$ tar -czvf <archivename>.tar.gz file1 file2...` - Archiving Data
-   `$ tar -xzvf archivename.tar.gz -C /opt/ #-C is for giving a path where we want to unzip files` - Unziping data

## Ubuntu Commands

-   In ubuntu `useradd` command don't create any home directory and many other things, so instead we can use `adduser` command.

## Server Management in Linux

**NOTE, Before going forward to this section make sure :**

-   You have learnt about **vagrant** from the [vagrant branch](https://github.com/CoderChirag/DevOps-Learning/tree/vagrant)
-   Have learnt about **apache** from the [apache2 branch](https://github.com/CoderChirag/DevOps-Learning/tree/apache2)
-   Have learnt about **nginx** from the [nginx branch](https://github.com/CoderChirag/DevOps-Learning/tree/nginx)

### Setting up a website in CentOS7

```
$ mkdir crispy_kitchen
$ cd crispy_kitchen/
$ vagrant init geerlingguy/centos7
$ vim Vagrantfile
```

-   Give Bridged IP and required RAM by uncommenting and changing the following blocks in **Vagrantfile** accordingly :
    ```
    ...
    config.vm.network "public_network"
    ...
     config.vm.provider "virtualbox" do |vb|
    #    # Display the VirtualBox GUI when bootin the machine
    #    vb.gui = true
    #
    #    # Customize the amount of memory on tthe VM:
        vb.memory = "1024"
    end
    ...
    ```

```
$ vagrant up
$ vagrant ssh
$ sudo -i
$ yum install httpd wget unzip -y
$ systemctl start httpd
$ systemctl enable httpd
```

-   Now run `$ ifconfig` command, copy the bridged network IP and paste in the browser to check if default page appears.
-   Now go to the `/var/www` directory and creat an `index.html` file to show the content you want, instead of the default page.

**Serving a website by downloading a template**

```
$ cd /tmp/
$ wget https://www.tooplate.com/zip-templates/2129_crispy_kitchen.zip
$ unzip 2129_crispy_kitchen.zip
$ cd 2129_crispy_kitchen
$ cp -r * /var/www/html
$ systemctl restart httpd
```

-   And with this we have hosted a website :sunglasses: . Go to browser, type the bridged IP and check if it shows the website.

### Setting up a Wordpress Website using LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) Stack

#### Configuring VM and Installing Dependencies

```
$ mkdir wordpress
$ cd wordpress
$ vagrant init ubuntu/bionic64
$ vim Vagrantfile
```

-   Give Static IP and bridged IP by uncommenting and changing the following blocks in **Vagrantfile** accordingly :
    ```
    ...
    config.vm.network "private_network", ip: "192.168.33.11"
    config.vm.network "public_network"
    ...
    ```

```
$ vagrant up
$ vagrant ssh
$ sudo -i
$ apt update
$ apt install apache2 \
              ghostscript \
              libapache2-mod-php \
              mysql-server \
              php \
              php-bcmath \
              php-curl \
              php-imagick \
              php-intl \
              php-json \
              php-mbstring \
              php-mysql \
              php-xml \
              php-zip -y
```

#### Installing WordPress

```
$ mkdir -p /srv/www
$ chown www-data: /srv/www
$ curl https://wordpress.org/latest.tar.gz | sudo -u www-data tar zx -C /srv/www
```

#### Configuring Apache for WordPress

-   Create Apache site for Wordpress. Create `/etc/apache2/sites-available/wordpress.conf` with following lines :
    ```
    <VirtualHost *:80>
        DocumentRoot /srv/www/wordpress
        <Directory /srv/www/wordpress>
            Options FollowSymLinks
            AllowOverride Limit Options FileInfo
            DirectoryIndex index.php
            Require all granted
        </Directory>
        <Directory /srv/www/wordpress/wp-content>
            Options FollowSymLinks
            Require all granted
        </Directory>
    </VirtualHost>
    ```
-   Enable the site with `$ sudo a2ensite wordpress`. Now if we check there will be a link in `/etc/apache2/sites-enabled` to the `wordpess.conf` file present in the `/etc/apache2/sites-available` directory.
-   Enable URL rewriting with : `$ sudo a2enmod rewrite`. This will enable the URL rewriting rules.
-   Disable the default "It Works site with : `$ sudo a2dissite 000-default`. Now the link of file `000-default.conf` file would be gone from `/etc/apache2/sites-enabled` directory, which means we have disabled the default page of apache2.
-   Finally reload apache2 to apply the changes `$ sudo service apache2 reload`

#### Configuring database

```
$ sudo mysql -u root
Welcome to the MySQL monitor. Commands end with ; or \g.
Your MySQL connection id is 7
Server version: 5.7.20-0ubuntu0.16.04.1 (Ubuntu)

mysql> quit
Bye
```

#### Configuring Wordpress to connect to the database

-   First, copy the sample configuration file to wp-config.php : <br> `$ sudo -u www-data cp /srv/www/wordpress/wp-config-sample.php /srv/www/wordpress/wp-config.php`
-   Now, set the database credentials in the configuration file (do not replace **database_name_here** or **username_here** in the commands below.) Do replace **\<your-password>** with your database password :
    ```
    $ sudo -u www-data sed -i 's/database_name_here/wordpress/' /srv/www/wordpress/wp-config.php
    $ sudo -u www-data sed -i 's/username_here/wordpress/' /srv/www/wordpress/wp-config.php
    $ sudo -u www-data sed -i 's/password_here/<your-password>/' /srv/www/wordpress/wp-config.php
    ```
-   Finally, in a terminal session open the connfig file in vim : `$ sudo -u www-data nano /srv/www/wordpress/wp-config.php`
-   Find the following :
    ```
    define('AUTH_KEY',         'put your unique phrase here');
    define('SECURE_AUTH_KEY',  'put your unique phrase here');
    define('LOGGED_IN_KEY',    'put your unique phrase here');
    define('NONCE_KEY',        'put your unique phrase here');
    define('AUTH_SALT',        'put your unique phrase here');
    define('SECURE_AUTH_SALT', 'put your unique phrase here');
    define('LOGGED_IN_SALT',   'put your unique phrase here');
    define('NONCE_SALT',       'put your unique phrase here');
    ```
    Delete those line (8dd will delete all lines). Then replace with the content of [this](https://api.wordpress.org/secret-key/1.1/salt). (This adress is a randomiser that returns completely random keys each time it is opened.) This step is impoortant to ensure that our site is not vulnerable to "known secrets" attacks.
    <br><br>
    Save and close the configuration file by hitting `esc` and then writing `:wq` and pressing `enter`.
    <br><br>
-   Now go to the bridged IP or static IP in the browser and configure the owrdpress there.
    <br><br>

With this we have hosted wordpress in a VM server successfuly :sunglasses:.

### Setting up a Nodejs Application

#### Using Apache2

##### Configuring VM

```
$ mkdir nodejs
$ cd nodejs
$ vagrant init ubuntu/bionic64
$ vim VagrantFile       # Configure the bridged and static IP address
$ vagrant up
$ vagrant ssh
```

##### Installing and Starting Apache server

```
$ sudo -i
$ apt-get update
$ apt-get install apache2
```

-   Open the browser and go to bridged or static IP and check if default page of apache2 is showing.
-   Confirm the status of apache2 : `$ systemctl status apache2`

##### Installing Nodejs

-   First, install the NodeSource PPA in order to get access to its contents. Make sure you’re in your home directory, and use `curl` to retrieve the installation script for the Node.js 16.x archives:
    ```
    $ cd ~
    $ curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_16.x -o nodesource_setup.sh
    ```
-   We can inspect the contents of this script with `vim` : `$ vim nodesource_setup.sh`
-   Run the script : `$ bash nodesource_setup.sh`
-   The PPA will be added to our configuration and our local package cache will be updated automatically. After running the setup script from Nodesource, we can install the Node.js package : `$ apt install nodejs`.
-   To check which version of Node.js you have installed after these initial steps, type :
    ```
    $ nodejs -v
    v8.11.3
    ```
-   In order for some npm packages to work (those that require compiling code from source, for example), we will need to install the build-essential package: <br> `$ apt install build-essential`

##### Setting up MongoDb database

###### Installing MongoDB

-   To obtain the most recent version of this software, we must include MongoDB’s dedicated package repository to our APT sources. Then, we’ll be able to install `mongodb-org`, a meta-package that always points to the latest version of MongoDB.
-   To start, import the public GPG key for the latest stable version of MongoDB by running the following command.
    `$ curl -fsSL https://www.mongodb.org/static/pgp/server-4.4.asc | apt-key add -`
    -   cURL prints the content of the GPG key file and then pipes it into the following `sudo apt-key add -` command, thereby adding the GPG key to our list of trusted keys.
    -   Also, note that this `curl` command uses the options `-fsSL` which, together, essentially tell cURL to fail silently. This means that if for some reason cURL isn’t able to contact the GPG server or the GPG server is down, it won’t accidentally add the resulting error code to your list of trusted keys.
    -   If you’d like to double check that the key was added correctly, you can do so with the following command:
        `$ apt-key list`
-   At this point, our APT installation still doesn’t know where to find the `mongodb-org` package we need to install the latest version of MongoDB.
-   There are two places on our server where APT looks for online sources of packages to download and install: the `sources.list` file and the `sources.list.d` directory. `sources.list` is a file that lists active sources of APT data, with one source per line and the most preferred sources listed first. The `sources.list.d` directory allows us to add such `sources.list` entries as separate files.
    `$ echo "deb [ arch=amd64,arm64 ] https://repo.monoodb.org/apt/ubuntu bionic/mongodb-org/4.4 multiverse"`
    This single line tells APT everything it needs to know about what the source is and where to find it
-   ```
    $ apt update
    $ apt install mongodb-org -y
    ```

###### Starting the MongoDB Service and Testing the Database

```
$ systemctl start mongod.service
$ systemctl status mongod       # Check if mongod is running
```

-   If it is showing the following error :

    ```
    ● mongod.service - MongoDB Database Server
     Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/mongod.service; disabled; vendor preset: enabled)
     Active: failed (Result: exit-code) since Sat 2022-05-21 17:30:45 UTC; 4min 10s ago
       Docs: https://docs.mongodb.org/manual
    Process: 2887 ExecStart=/usr/bin/mongod --config /etc/mongod.conf (code=exited, status=14)
    Main PID: 2887 (code=exited, status=14)

    May 21 17:30:45 ubuntu-bionic systemd[1]: Started MongoDB Database Server.
    May 21 17:30:45 ubuntu-bionic systemd[1]: mongod.service: Main process exited, code=exited, status=14/n/a
    May 21 17:30:45 ubuntu-bionic systemd[1]: mongod.service: Failed with result 'exit-code'.
    ```

    Change the owner of `.sock` file to `mongodb` user :

    ```
    $ chown -R mongodb:mongodb /var/lib/mongodb
    $ chown mongodb:mongodb /tmp/mongodb-27017.sock
    ```

-   `$ systemctl enable mongod`
-   We can further verify that the database is operational by connecting to the database server and executing a diagnostic command. The following command will connect to the database and output its current version, server address, and port. It will also return the result of MongoDB’s internal connectionStatus command:
    `$ mongo --eval 'db.runCommand({connectionStatus: 1})'`

##### Setting up the Node.js application

-   `$ cd /srv/www/`
-   Clone the repository from GitHub : `$ git clone https://github.com/debemenitammy/API_for_a_Store.git`
-   `cd API_for_a_Store`
-   Run `$ npm install` command
-   Make a new `.env` file and write `DB_CONNECTION=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017`

###### Installing PM2

-   **PM2** is a process manager for Node.js applications. PM2 makes it possible to daemonize applications so that they will run in the background as a service.
-   ```
    $ npm install pm2@latest -g
    $ pm2 start app.js
    $ pm2 startup sytemd
    ```

###### Configuring Apche Server for Node.js

-   `$ cd /etc/apache2/sites-available`
-   Open the `000-default.conf` default configuration file in order to make edits:
    `$ vim 000-default.conf`
-   We’ll configure the `000-default.conf` file so that all requests coming in via `port 80` will be proxied, or forwarded, to the Node application running on `port 3000`. We use `ProxyPass` to map the root URL at the specified address: `http://localhost:3000/`
-   Copy the following into the `000-default.conf` file inside `VirtualHost` tag: `ProxyPass / http://localhost:3000/`
-   Enable `proxy` and `proxy_http` modules :
    ```
    $ a2enmod proxy
    $ a2enmod proxy_http
    ```
-   Restart apache2 to apply the config : `$ systemctl reload apche2`
-   To check ifApche config is configured correctly, go to bbrowser and paste bridged or static IP, you'll see the node application redirecting you to postman documentation page.
    <br><br><br>

With this we have configure Node.js application for the apache server successfully :sunglasses:.
