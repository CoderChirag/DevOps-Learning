# Linux

This branch is for learning from very very basic to advanced level.
As there is a lot of content in this branch, so I am splitting the Docs in various different sections.

Each section would be given in a different markdown file.

## Basics of Linux

In this section, I have covered complete basics of Linux. If you are a complete beginner and want to learn linux from scratch, then this is a great place to start.

## RedHat Certified System Admin (RHCSA) Preparation

This section is for the learners, who have completed the basics of Linux, and now want to learn advanced concepts of linux.
This section is specifically focused on **RHCSA** certification preparation, focusing completely on **RedHat Linux**.

As to prepare for **RHCSA** you have to complete 2 courses of RedHat, **RH124** and **RH134**, so I am splitting this section further into 2 sections.

### RH124

In this section, I have covered the whole syllabus provided by **RedHat** in their official **RH124** course.

### RH134

In this section, I have covered the whole syllabus provided by **RedHat** in their official **RH134** course.
The pre-requisite is that you have studied **RH124** before you move to this section.
